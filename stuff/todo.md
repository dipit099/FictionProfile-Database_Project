# Tentative Pages of our website


1. Account 
        Contains : General Info of the user/moderator (this is common since we only bother about the info)

        ** For Admin ** 
        Display and Feature:
            a. Basically every operation that ever occured. This aligns with our project rubric for bonus marks
                What I understand is that we just need to show the changes in our database that is simply said that - 
                we will show when someone posts, or if some moderator approves request, or some user reports something.
                We will not update every little things as some comment addition is trivial. 
                Also remeber that it should be stored in separate table as per rubrik.
            b. Approve moderator to join the team.
